On the other hand, OhCircus is a formal specification language which unifies Z, CSP, the refinement cal- culus and object-oriented theories. In this work, we are concerned with their integration, translating UML class diagrams into OhCircus specifications. In particular, our approach uses, beyond the syntactic mapping, the concept of class model to capture, naturally, associations and global constraints. Finally, we use our own work to prove the refinement of associations as attributes, a much desired result linking analysis to design and implementation.",UFPE,INTEGRATING UML AND FORMAL METHODS

2005,Computer Science,"It is known that successful software development companies are based on an efficient project management methodology. This task, however, is not simple. Firstly, many of the available models (like PMBOK) are generic to projects of any nature, not only to software development. At second, these models often do not apply to all companies’ sizes and structure. This paper approaches these aspects and objectives to: A) Identify an enterprise lifecycle model that classifies the companies according to their maturity and applies to software enterprises; B) Identify a software development project management process model, detailing its subprocesses, techniques, inputs and outputs artifacts; C) Associate each of the item B subprocesses to the stages of item A model.",UFPE,Managing software projects in companies with different maturity levels

They also enhance means for apprentices acompaniement and help from teachers. This allows teachers to understand what has been done by the apprentice as well as to consider to pose challenges related to what is being studied. One of the most necessary functions in such systems is the data input module. Through them, users can register, courses are created, mensages are posted, chats can have all the interaction registered, documents can be stored and so on. Thus, the main goal of this work is to functionally and structurally specify data input modules in LVE. For that, an analysis of such modules in some LVE shall point out their weaknesses and strong points allowing suggestions for improvements. A comparative study shall be done aiming at the conception of a optimized data input module that maybe utilized by different LVE.

2008,Computer Science,"Software Reuse has grown in maturity and relevance over the past several years and now it is considered one of the most plausible mean to bring to the industry better levels of productivity, quality, time-to-market and hence, competitiveness. A well succeeded Software Reuse program comprises in many different strategies, varying from technical perspective to the organizational and managerial perspective. Among the technical factors in software reuse, a reusable asset repository plays an important role in reuse programs since it stores valuable, experienced knowledge. Despite its benefits, an asset repository must be populated with reusable artifacts in order to be useful to developers; otherwise, its adoption is definitively compromised. On the other hand, already developed software is available at several open repositories on the internet and at companies’ own private repository. The effort needed do identify reusable artifacts from these existing sources must be considered. This work lies under this motivation. We are trying to answer questions such as, how can we assist engineers in the process of identifying candidates of components from existing source code? What kind of heuristics and metrics should be blend (and how) in order to get better results? How can we make it scalable to large systems? We have analyzed current approaches on component identification, techniques and tools, mainly focused on software clustering. We specified, designed and implemented a tool to help engineers in indentifying reusable modules from java source code: the CORE Loader.

2008,Computer Science,"Beyond the inherent problems to a single project, the IT industry is predominantly a multiproject environment, in other words, an environment in which several projects are conducted simultaneously, sharing scarce resources among them. If manage projects alone is a challenge, the multiproject environment becomes a challenge even greater for the team management. Several frameworks and models have been proposed to assist the needs of management of this environment. The “Modelo para o Gerenciamento de Múltiplos Projetos de Software – MGMPS (Model for Multi Software Projects Management) referenced in this work, is based on PMBOK, but uses different concepts presented in the other models. Unlike the previous ones, this model seeks to remove the shortcomings of others models when applied to the particularities of multiproject environment. But all models make use of many processes and activities, requiring software support to facilitate the implementation of the management activities. Then, this software market began to grow rapidly. The tools made automatic procedures performed manually before, began to organize information and standardize processes. Based in this context, this work does a research, presentation and analysis of multiple projects management software. In addition to research conducted by specialized companies, it will be presented a comparison of features of these software based on needs for the completion of procedures under MGMPS.",UFPE,An assessment of multiple project management tools

2008,Computer Science,"With the growth of the perceived complexity in organizations, systems thinking has been increasingly important to professional effectiveness. The ability to understand the functioning of structures involved allows the professional to anticipate consequences and evaluate problematic situations so that their actions are more effective. Moreover, many organizations are increasingly looking for study, learn, disseminate, train, deploy and develop the knowledge, methodologies, practices and tools employed in the area of project management. Actually, in a project, the role of greater prominence defined by the PMI (Project Management Institute) is the manager, primarily responsible for the success of the project. To play their roles, the manager should be able to plan, monitor and decide during the whole project period. The decision-making process, in turn, involves all areas managed and it is for the manager to evaluate the individual, the project and the organizational objectives as a whole. Thus, the application of systemic modeling in project management promotes a holistic approach to management as it allows greater understanding of the influences majority in the project, identification of premises managerial implied, incorporation of human factors, dynamic vision of the work processes, explicit representation of the project behavior and support strategic analysis policies, identifying therefore the major trends of the project.

Accordingly, the necessary efforts to achieve the desired results have been concentrated, increasingly, the role of project manager. The prominence of the office, in turn, makes more critical the task of allocating people who really have the abilities, competencies and behaviors to be successful. Seeing through this perspective, the need for tools that help companies to evaluate these characteristics becomes essential. Several models have been created and developed both to define competencies that are essential to the function, as to know how to identify them and evaluate which level theses competencies is manifested in the behavior of an individual on your performance. This work presents as proposal examine the existence of relations between the personal which competencies defined as necessary for the project manager in the variables of PMCD Framework and the behavioral profiles described in the Symlog model, with the objective to analyze which of theses shows more appropriate to the role of project manager.

The context experienced by firms today is, no matter of their size, very different from that in the 1980`s. According to Mytelka (2000), two causes are determinant to explain such changes. Firstly, the production of goods and services has become more specialized in a large spectrum of industries and, secondly, the competition between firms has become global and more knowledge based. This innovation based competition has accelerated considerably the technological changes increasing the demand for the firms in developing countries to get even more involved in the continuous process of innovation despite the sector in which they are located (MYTELKA, 2000).

Among all the mechanisms used to classify network traffic, the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most used technique. However it is a mandatory requirement that the ISP DPI system must have a good set of application protocol signatures, in order to have an accurate traffic classification and an acceptable completeness level. Building this set of signatures is a very time consuming task and demands a high expertise, in order to make them very accurate and specific for each application. This thesis presents a set of tools capable to ease the job of construction, test and characterization of signatures for DPI systems. Three tools were built for this purpose: (i) a signature generator, capable of identifying common substrings used by an application protocol and merging them into signatures; (ii) a pattern generator, which will help the user characterize all the aspects of the generated signature; (iii) and a traffic generator that is responsible for creating totally configurable per application class flows, whose packet payload will carry signatures that can be detected by DPI systems.",UFPE,AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE GENERATION
2009,Computer Science,"The investments, in general, have three basics characteristics: return, term and protection. The investor should analyse the profitable, the liquidity and the risk of each application before put their money. The profit is proportional to the risk, which means that how bigger is the rental, more risked will be the application. The main challenge to the investors is to optimize this equation. A portfolio of investment is a group of assets that belongs to a investor. So he must make his portfolio in a way that it be efficient. Clustering is a non-supervisioned classification of patterns in group. These groups are built based on similarity. Therefore, intuitively, we deduce that patterns which are inside the same group present more similarity than patterns that are in different groups. Our purpose in the research is to present a system that will give support to the creation of an optimized portfolio. To get this purpose we will use differents algorithms of clustering, applying them in historical datas of some assets of Bovespa with the purpose of find the similarities between them and just like that group them in the most appropriate way. Then, we will present a comparative analysis between the results achieved by each one of the algorithms.

Big companies and governmental bodies endured a series of losses in the IT systems production, which, most of times, did not meet their needs. This was due to software development being done ad- hoc. The scarce success cases were the result of individual effort from committed professionals. Models of software development processes then appeared to standardize the best practices in systems development. From that day on, there was an increase in the expectations that all issues in development would be addressed by adopting a development process. That did not occur because there is no ideal process for all software companies. What truly exist are models of processes that must be customized for each organization. Define a process correctly and define a continuous process improvement are the biggest challenges for the companies. To analyze whether a model is appropriate to a given organization, software processes evaluation must be carried out.

There are two basic approaches to the construction of IBE system. The first one, upon which Boneh-Franklin [2] scheme in based, builds IBE systems using bilinear maps [3,4,5]. The resulting systems are efficient both in performance and ciphertext length. The second approach, due to Cocks [6], builds an elegant IBE system based on the quadratic residuosity problem modulo an RSA composite N. The ciphertext in this system contains two elements of Z/NZ to each bit of the plaintext. Hence, the encryption of an l-bit message yields a ciphertext of size 2l · log2N bits. For example, encrypting a 128-bit message using a 1024 bits modulo, the resulting ciphertext is of size 32678 bytes. For comparison, pairing based methods produce a 36 byte ciphertext. An open problem since Cocks scheme was the construction of a space efficient IBE scheme without pairings, namely a system with short ciphertexts. In 2007, Boneh, Gentry and Hamburg [7] proposed such a system. In their scheme, the ciphertext size is about l + log2N. Encrypting a 128-bit message produces a ciphertext of size 145 bytes. The security of the system is based on the quadratic residuosity problem. Encryption time in this system is quartic on the security parameter, while in the most part of practical public-key system the encryption is cubic on the security parameter. The objective of this work is to study and spell out the Boneh-Gentry-Hamburg scheme.",UFPE,SPACE-EFFICIENT IDENTITY-BASED ENCRYPTION

2009,Computer Science,"This work introduces different pattern classifiers for interval data based on the logistic regres- sion methodology. Six approaches are considered. These approaches differ in the way of representing the intervals and in the model of regression used. The first classifier considers that each interval is represented by a pair of quantitative variables and performs a classic linear regression on these variables. The second considers that each interval is a pair of quantitative variables, but performs two separate classic linear regressions on these variables and cambine the results in a appropriate way. The second classifier considers that each interval is represented by the centers of the intervals and performs a classic logistic regression on the centers of the intervals. The third one assumes each interval as a pair of quantitative variables and performs a conjoint classic logistic regression on these variables. The fourth one considers that each interval is represented by its vertices and a classic logistic regression on the vertices of the in- tervals is applied. The last one also assumes each interval as a pair of quantitative variables, but performs two separate classic logistic regressions on these variables and combine the results in some appropriate way.

2009,Computer Science,"Recent advances that occurred in the last decade in the areas of computer graphics, multime- dia and telecommunication, have influenced the evolution of the manipulation, the use and the transmission of digital data on the Internet. Three-dimensional data are currently the emer- ging media and in this context, 3D objects, or 3D meshes are used in various user-centered applications, which suggests the need to incorporate details of human visual perception in the processing of these meshes. Although excellent work of incorporating principles of perception related to images have been published, there has been little attention paid to the use of metrics, inspired by visual perception, for processing 3D meshes using only the information in it. The mesh, on it’s own, contains geometric information capable of showing repeated patterns that even on high curvature regions are visually unattractive, because it’s the unusual that delights and interests. Based on this description, the concept of mesh saliency was introduced as a measure of regional importance for three-dimensional meshes. This graduate work is contextualized in the computer graphics, which classifies the metrics of visual perception as essential. We propose the generation of images containning more visual content, implementing the algorithm of mesh saliency, introduced by Lee in 2005, using the Meshlab system for processing 3D meshes. From the results obtained with the algorithm, we review some basic concepts of non-photorealistic rendering features, like silhouettes, aiming to create images with greater perceptual and artistic content.

An existing cryptographic system is based on permutation transformations and applies the encryption prior to the coding stages in order to preserve or improve the spatial correlation of the video frames. The technique has a very good performance, in compression rate and video quality, with low motion video sequences. However, the possible improvement on the spa- tial correlation depends on the temporal correlation between consecutive frames. Hence, in videos with considerable motion, the technique’s performance decreases significantly. The objective of this work is to propose modifications on the permutation computation and a mechanism to explore the video temporal correlation more properly by using mo- tion estimation algorithms to obtain a better performance, in terms of processing time, compression rate and video quality, especially in high motion video sequences.",UFPE,ENCRYPTION AND COMPRESSION OF DIGITAL VIDEO BASED ON PERMUTATION
2012,Computer Science,"A project has activities carried out by a team of people who work for a common goal. There are several methodologies for software development that are used to create a practical approach to project management, to organize these activities and to assess factors such as time, cost, quality and human resources. In this process, the effort estimation activity is a key element for the success of the project. This practice has been used in both traditional and agile methods. Measurable data are derived from the use of estimation techniques on the project size metric, ranging from analogies between projects based on developer experience to methodical approaches using mathematical models. One of these techniques is the Planning Poker, which is an agile estimation technique. Due to the interactive and practical nature of it, agile teams can estimate and assimilate task sizes very fast. Nevertheless, the Planning Poker has some limitations, such as the fact that it doesn’t work well in distributed agile teams and the face-to-face interaction is the very essence of it. There are some tools available to estimate by playing it, each one has positive and negative features. This final work presents a Planning Poker approach. From there, the main idea is to propose a practical tool to estimate using this technique, focused on Scrum teams, and to be applied to the project management and monitoring.",UFPE,Planning support tool based on Planning Poker using Scrum methodology
2012,Computer Science,"Aspect oriented languages promote separation of concerns by enabling the modularization of crosscutting concerns. Among these languages two categories can be devised that represent how they expose the joinpoints of a program (points or events in the execution of a program where crosscutting concerns must interact with non-crosscutting ones). Some of them expose a fixed (implicit) set of joinpoints, while others require that developers explicitly indicate where both types of concern are allowed to interact. A distinctive example of a crosscutting concern that can be modularized with aspect oriented languages is the exception handling of a program. Several studies have been conducted to understand the adequacy of implicit jointpoint aspect oriented languages, like AspectJ, for the modularization of such concern [Lippert e Lopes 2000; Castor Filho et al. 2009; Taveira et al. 2009]. This work, in turn, intends to perform an initial assessment regarding an aspect oriented language with explicit events and the exception handling of an existing program. We intend to present the Ptolemy language [Rajan and Leavens 2008; 9] as well as its capabilities and limitations for the exception handling of a system.",UFPE,Modularization of the Treatment of Exceptions with Explicit Events

2012,Computer Science,"The global market's high level of competitivity created a need for corporations to find solutions that guarantee their survival. One of the solutions was to decentralize development to obtain advantages from several different locations, like specialized labor, tax incentives, etc. As competition in the area of IT is also elevated and the softwares are easily handled (send, decompose and unite), IT companies begun to use Distributed Development of Software (DDS). However, acquiring quality communication, the main critical factor for this kind of project, was also a big challenge to overcome, since distributed teams tend to communicate less and more poorly, due to the spatial distance between them. With the arrival of Web 2.0 and its tools, it was clear that these tools' features met the need of aid and communication of DDS. Because of this, studies regarding this subject emerged and the Web 2.0 tools begun to be used in DDS projects. This graduation monograph aims to list and analyze the use of Web 2.0 tools in the aid to communication on DDS. To achieve this objective, this work performs a bibliographical review on its main subjects (DDS, Web 2.0, its tools and its uses on DDS) and, posteriorly, will create a theoretical foundation and a qualitative research on these subjects. The expected result is to obtain a panorama of the usage of Web 2.0 tools on the communication between DDS project teams.",UFPE,WEB 2.0 TOOLS SUPPORTING DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNICATION

2012,Computer Science,"There are many studies on the problem of portfolio optimization and the use of heuristic techniques for investigating the optimal portfolio. However, almost none of these studies work with the algorithm of artificial bee colony (CAA). In the cardinality constrained mean–variance model (CCMV), the portfolio optimization problem is a mixed-integer quadratic programming (nonlinear) for which efficient algorithms do not exist. The objective of this study was to apply the technique of CAA to the problem of portfolio optimization. The set of test data used is formed by the weekly price indices: Hang Seng, Hong Kong, DAX 100 in Germany, FTSE 100 UK, S & P 100 U.S. and Nikkei 225 in Japan between March 1992 and September 1997. The results of this study showed that CAA had better results than other optimization algorithms compared: genetic algorithm, tabu search, simulated annealing, PSO. Because for the stock Hang Seng, FTSE 100 and S&P 100 both the value of the Mean Euclidian distance and the values of the variance error and return error were lower, showing that the values are better. However, for the actions DAX 100 and Nikkei 225, even the CAA obtained lower values for the distance, showed higher values for the variance error and return error, with it, cannot be said that the results were better than the other algorithms but that was as favorable as they are.

In the literature, researches have been done using different approaches for the requirements engineering, such as the goal-oriented and business process-based approaches. In the first case, the use of the i* framework has been highlighted to rationale and model the organizational environment. The i* focuses on the organizational actors who depend on each other, so that goals are achieved, tasks are performed and resources are provided. In the second case, the use of the BPMN notation has gained space on the business process modeling, making the capture of complex functioning of organizations a simpler task, easier to understand by the stakeholders and consistent with the business reality. The purpose of this work is, therefore, to conduct a comparative study between the Santander's method (which uses the goal-oriented approach) and De la Vara's method (which uses the approach based on business processes) to generate specifications of use cases scenarios. Using these methods enables requirements engineers, as well as others involved in software requirements, to specify software requirements more correctly, completely and aligned with the organization's goals.

2014,Computer Science,"Navigation is a common task related to 3D content in which the user is able to move and rotate the virtual camera in order to explore a virtual environment. In most scenarios the navigation interaction occurs through regular devices such as keyboard, mouse and joysticks. Alternatively, considering the system is able to interpret body and hand gestures, the interaction can be designed to be more natural and user friendly. Gesture metaphors have proven to be a powerful tool for human computer interaction. Examples arise from smartphones to state of the art projects like the Holodesk [1] (from Microsoft Research). However, regarding the use of gestures for navigation in virtual environments, a specific limitation arises related to the user movement in the real space. The gestures should provide the user a way of turning the virtual camera direction without losing the view of the screen. Moreover, the user must be able to move long distances in the virtual environment without trespassing real world boundaries and without becoming fatigued. In this context, this monograph presents a study on the problem of navigation in virtual environments with fixed displays visualization (e.g. projections and TVs) using gestures. It also shows an implementation of a prototype of one of the metaphors developed during this work with an industrial scenario in a CAVE environment using Makey Makey [2] technology. From the study, we validated the use of the Wizard of Oz technique for prototyping interactions with gestures in real time. It was also noticed that, in the choice of gestures for navigation in a virtual environment with displays display fixed, the users commonly use more the hands and upper limbs, and less the lower limbs. It was also realized that to move forward, the gesture of pointing to the direction was the most requested. And some users chose gestures that, initially, did not seem tiresome when executed only once, however, became tiresome in the long term. As a result of the implementation of the prototype of one of the metaphors, it was found that it is possible to use it in an industrial virtual scenario in a CAVE environment together with Makey Makey technology.",UFPE,STUDY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF 3D INTERACTION METAPHORS WITH FOCUS ON NAVIGATION IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS

By doing this, any defect can be identified and removed. Software Engineering is not an exception: high quality software construction requires a combination of project activities and verification throughout the development. However, there are important details that should compose high-quality software that are often forgotten or are not well evaluated by developers during the implementation. Performance is one of these important parts.

2014,Computer Science,"In the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of smartphones around the world. At the end of 2013, 1.4 billion smartphones’s users were accounted, with predictions indicating that it will exceed the amount of personal computers still in 2014. In this scenario, Android is the most dominant Operating System at the smartphone’s market, representing 81% of them and growing every year its supremacy. Among the technologies present in mobile devices, the battery consists in one of the most important parts, lately having been the least evolved segment, not keeping up with the evolution of other components. On the whole, the opportunity presents itself to study ways of improving the energy consumption and the efficiency of smartphones, in a way of making then more ubiquitous and more independent.

2015,Computer Science,"There isn’t anything new about using the concept of exception to identify and handle logical flow disruptions, but there are a few problems associated to the exception interfaces in some languages. As an example, we can say the throws clause used in Java is enough to analyze the exception flow locally, but it is limited in a global context for both control and manutenability. To overcome this issue, an extension to the Java language (called EPiC-Java) was created, providing a special syntax to specify exceptions flows from throw sites to handle sites in just one sentence, but no tools were developed to provide IDE support. That being so, this work aims to adapt EPiC-Java syntax and make it portable to Eclipse environment as a plug-in.",UFPE,Support for Two-Dimensional Interfaces for Java Exceptions in the Eclipse Development Platform

2014,Computer Science,"Due to its recent developments, Augmented Reality (AR) technology started to be widely used in various application domains, such as advertising, medicine, education, robotics, entertainment, tourism, and others. However, the time and technical expertise needed to create AR applications has prevented widespread use. In this sense, authoring tools have become a largely used solution to boost mainstream use of AR, since they facilitate the development of AR experiences. Augmented reality authoring tools can provide various levels of abstraction in application development, establishing different levels of interface complexity, concept abstractions, and technical skills demands. Particularly, those categorized as content design tools present a high abstraction layer, which substantially simplifies the user interface to a point that even people with few or no technical expertise can create and deploy AR content. Therefore, these tools are a critical component to the success and growth of augmented reality since they allow it to be explored by ordinary users, which have expertise only in their actuation areas. Due to their increasing relevance, this monograph aims at conducting a trend analysis in order to understand the current tendencies in the area of content design tools: the authoring paradigms and the distribution strategies of AR solutions that have been used. For this purpose, both commercial and academic tools were analyzed concerning their dataflows, which describe the end-to-end scenario that outlines from the creation of AR semantic through authoring tools to its visualization by end-users. In turn, the identification of AR authoring and deployment trends allowed the translation of project-specific dataflows, observed in the analyzed content design tools, into the creation of general dataflow models. In this sense, a minimum number of combinations of trends were performed in order to elaborate four generic models in which all of the content design tools could fit into. Furthermore, in order to investigate and illustrate all the theoretical foundations approached in this work, a case study was performed as a complement to this monograph. The main purpose was to analyze whether a high-level content design tool is, indeed, easy to use and permits a diverse audience to build AR applications. Hence, the Augie Studio tool was created and further evaluated by programmers and non-programmers. By measuring the amount of time spent to realize specific tasks using the tool, examining answers obtained from an evaluation questionnaire, and analyzing additional commentaries collected from a non-structured interview, it was confirmed that the tool meets its intended purpose.",UFPE,HIGH-LEVEL AUTHORING TOOLS IN AUGMENTED REALITY: ANALYSIS AND CASE STUDY

The biggest companies now seek to use this large volume of data, volatile or not, for their benefit. The challenge comes in the form of identifying similar sentiments (complaints, praise, criticism ...) inside this large volume, as well as the integration of such data. One of the challenges of record linkage is to identify record that belongs to the same entity (person, business, traffic lights, buses ...). This problem is called Entity Resolution.

2015,Computer Science,"For a company to be adaptable to the constant changes required by the market, it must have a simple and easily understandable modeling of its entities. The BPMN notation (Business Process Modeling Notation) has as main objective the mode of representation of business processes to be easily understood by all. [5] The organizational modeling is a necessity for understanding the business environment, helping to understand the complex interactions between organizations and people. [6] In this context arises oriented modeling purposes, an approach that prioritizes the goals that users expect the system, and it has grown as a promising way to describe systems that actually fulfill the wishes of stakeholders. It provides a way to identify and specify both the objectives of the stakeholders with respect to the intended system, such as the characteristics of the system itself. [7] i * framework is an approach from GORE (Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering) formulated to represent, model and analyze organizational objectives [8]. During the lifecycle of the business process model when changes occur in a model, they should spread to other business models in order to maintain consistency. Combinations of complementary notations (as i * and BPMN) offer a higher conceptual support to changes. To reflect changes in the organizational context to changes in business process design means aligning business processes with organizational goals. Similarly, operational improvements can be mapped back to organizational objectives facilitating analysis and assuring no conflict with existing targets [10]. The iStar2BPMN [11] is a tool developed for the purpose of turning i* models BPMN models, and vice versa. It includes graphical editors for i* and BPMN, and enables the transformation between these models from mapping guidelines clearly defined [12]. However, the tool does not allow import and export models built with other popular tools that support modeling i* and BPMN like OpenOME [14] and the Bizagi [18], respectively. The main objective of this work is to enable the recognition of diagrams created with the Istar2Bpmn tool for popular tools like OpenOME and Bizagi and vice versa.",UFPE,INTEGRATION OF THE ISTAR2BPMN TOOL WITH OPENOME AND BIZAGI

The blockchain is a linked list of blocks where the nodes insert new blocks by investing in computational resources, in a process called bitcoin mining. The network is considered to be secure since it has a sufficient large number of miners. There are two types of incentives to mining: the reward for new block created and transaction fees. Currently, the reward for new block is much more relevant than the fees, which are small and optional, but the reward is halved every 4 year until it converges to 0 in the future. This means that it might be necessary to change the mechanism of transaction fees in order to guarantee the security of the network.

Increasingly information technology companies invest heavily in such paradigm in order to provide their customers the best way to store data and to allow easy access and retrieval. However, the way such information is managed faces a variety of restrictions; therefore it is needed to address new aspects to overcome these barriers in order to provide information adequately. According to the CAP theorem (Brewer et al 2012), a distributed system on a large scale can simultaneously provide two of the three features, namely: 1. Availability; 2. Consistency; and 3. Partition Tolerance. With this restriction, cloud database technologies, mostly choose to provide greater availability and partition tolerance, relaxing consistency aspects. Each cloud database system provides a different level of consistency or even a configurable one, being necessary to define specific methods and policies.

However, as modern society evolved, these tools began to have their purpose redefined, fun was no longer their primary focus, instead being replaced with new objectives such as education and research. The advent of game theory as a formally recognized field of research allowed researchers to take full advantage of one of the most important aspects of digital games: immersion. Economists, biologists, and even modern day psychologists make use of the guidelines and models proposed by game theorists to build game scenarios that reflect the real world as closely as possible, in which the answers and reactions of their agents, the players, are as equal to those that would arise in reality.

The main purpose of this work is the analysis of the electronic sports competitive scenario and to propose a mobile tool, accessible and ubiquitous to narrate matches based on crowdsourced textcasting. The proposed solution was a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) application developed based on Android platform to narrate matches with its users providing text descriptions of matches, with minimalist interface and based on the use of text templates. A prototype functional tool was developed, with survey indicating good acceptance of the target audience. Tests with the user group resulted in interface adjustments of the already implemented interface and inspired the definition of future features to be included. It was concluded that it is necessary to complement the existing eSports’ broadcast options, with crowdsourced textcasting as a functional and operational option with good acceptance by users.

2016,Computer Science,"The mobile market is facing an unprecedented growth, with iOS and Android platforms playing a central role in this arena. Recently, Apple released Swift, a modern programming language built to be the successor of Objective-C. In less than a year and a half after its first release, Swift became one of the most popular programming languages, considering different popularity measures. A significant part of this success is due to Apple’s strict control over its ecosystem, and the clear message that it will replace Objective-C in a near future. This distinctive scenario presents a unique opportunity to understand the adoption of a programming language from its very early stages. According to Apple, “Swift is a powerful and intuitive program- ming language[...]. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syn- tax is concise yet expressive.” However, little is known about how Swift developers perceive these benefits. In this paper, we conducted two studies aimed at uncovering the questions and strains that arise from this early adoption. First, we perform a thorough analysis on 59,156 questions asked about Swift on StackOverflow. Second, we interviewed 12 Swift developers to cross- validate the initial results. Our study reveals that developers do seem to find the language easy to understand and adopt, although 17.5% of the questions are about basic elements of the language. Still, there are many questions about problems in the toolset (compiler, Xcode, libraries).

2016,Computer Science,"Multithreaded programs are hard to write when threads share resources. To deal with this resource sharing, programs typically use synchronization. However inadequate thread synchronization may generate several problems such as deadlock. To solve this problem, developers have created forms of detection or prevention as: static detection, dynamic detection and verification models. Recently a new approach has been created where the deadlock is detected in runtime, and its occurrence is signaled by an exception. The main goal of this work is to add contextual information to deadlock exceptions [LOBO; CASTOR, 2015], in order to improve the traceability of problems, informing more details about the deadlock found. Always taking into account the overhead created. To achieve this goal studies have been made to determine what information is useful for the user to understand the deadlock and how the error message should be displayed to the user. The new informations were added and the performance overhead was measured using a very conservative benchmark.

The management of the lifecycle of these containers can be done by orchestrators, as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. Deciding which tool is most appropriate depends on an analysis of many aspects of the application and of the available resources in the execution environment. Experiments were made with each orchestrator, comparing start up time and node loss fault tolerance, as well as setup complexity and feature analysis. Docker Swarm presents itself as more appropriate for clusters with less computing resources and simpler appli- cations that don’t need autoscaling management. Kubernetes is more appropriate for applications that can be executed in environments with more resources and more machi- nes, and more critical applications that need autoscaling and more complex deployment cycles.",UFPE,Comparative study between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes for container orchestration in software architectures with microservices
2016,Computer Science,"The World Wide Web is a great resource for structured entities. Entities can be defined as real world objects defined by their attributes and associated values. The practical value of com- prehensive repositories on domain specific structured entities can easily be seen, for instance, on improving results on entity queries - the most frequent type of query search after naviga- tional queries - and data-driven decisions. Before making use of those repositories, one must collect such structured entities. The main goal of this work is to implement an effective so- lution to the sub-task of locating and identifying pages containing relevant structured entities from the real estate domain within a website. To locate entitity pages, we developed a strategy that makes use of a link classifier to predict if a link points towards an entity page, thus avoiding unproductive areas of the websites. To detect real estate enitity pages, we built a page classifier that identifies pages with real estate entities with high precision.",UFPE,A Smart Collector for Structured Real Estate Entities in Sites

2016,Computer Science,"There are several purposes that can lead to the creation of a portfolio, but the most common is the presentation of the best work of an individual with the intention of per- sonal promotion during the search for employment. What a lot of people do not know is that when applied to the educational area, portfolios can influence the student to be more reflective about their work, thus leading to the development of the student’s critical ability. Students seeking computing degrees usually take many courses that have several activities during it and a lot of those end up being lost or forgotten after the course is finished. These activities are sometimes given by teachers through class management tools, which facilitate student-teacher interaction. This work presents the result of the implementation of a web platform that allows teachers to indirectly influ- ence their students to create a personal portfolio with the activities done during their courses. Using this platform, students can easily access all of their work made during their time in university and create a public portfolio when needed with ease.",UFPE,MyFolio: an electronic oil for undergraduate students in computer courses
2016,Computer Science,"Wireless communication is present in several segments and environments. Combined with the continuous miniaturization of hardware components, cost reduction and expansion in pro- cessing capacity, it has encouraged the development and use of Wireless Ad hoc Network. Unlike traditional communication networks, Wireless Ad hoc Network does not have a centralized in- frastructure of management and control, thus resulting in the need of distributed management and control among the nodes of the network, considering energy constraints, memory limita- tion and processing capacity, which brings great challenges when designing protocols for such technology. This work will present a survey of multi-channel protocols from the medium access control layer - (MAC) to ad hoc networks most commonly cited in the literature, a classifica- tion, a comparative and evolutionary evaluation of protocols, and finally a discussion about the open challenges and possible future work.",UFPE,A Classification and Comparative Analysis of Multichannel Access Control Protocols Media for Ad Hoc Networks
2016,Computer Science,"The World Wide Web is a repository with innumerous pages of all kind of information. Some of these pages contain information about instances of structured entities along with its attribu- tes and associated values. For example, a webpage that contains information about a laptop showing its attributes, such as its operational system and processor. The primary goal of this work is to detect, effectively and efficiently, whether a website contains pages with structured entities in the real estate domain. With the aid of a focused crawler that crawls through the Web graph exploring the neighborhood of already known sites, we use the detector to guide it in fin- ding innumerous real estate sites across the Web. Once these sites are located, it is possible to, for example, do a follow-up crawling inside them to extract the information about the entities and create a database with them.",UFPE,Detecting Large Scale Entity Sites: The Case of Real Estate Sites
2016,Computer Science,"The increase in government spending has been a constant problem in Brazil (GASTO, 2016), due to corruption and poor management of expenditures. In education it is no different the poor management of control over meals or student attendance, results in waste or unnecessary expenditure. The purpose of this work is to develop an application to control expenditure on education based on an existing one, focused on the control of expenses in the Conceito Fiscal2 (STAFF, 2016). The management of expenses in education, more precisely with meals, contributes to the transparency of public spen- ding, besides establishing a direct communication between schools and the Ministery of Education, making it possible for instance the complete control over the products foreseen by the bidding and those that actually arrive at school.",UFPE,An Application to Control Public Expenses: The Case of School Lunch
2016,Computer Science,"The air market has a large share in the current economy, moving billions of passengers, goods and money in a global scenario. This market is extremely fierce, in which several com- panies compete for passengers in order to increase their profits. In this competition, companies take complex market strategies in order to attract consumers, making this market a very com- plex environment. In order to understand this complex scenario, it is necessary to analyze the data a to understand patterns of behavior of the companies with respect to their strategies of market which can help not only the companies but also the direct consumers (passengers) . The data generated in the airline ticket market are complex involving spatial and tempo- ral components. Given this complexity, interactive data visualization techniques are recognized as efficient tools that assist in the exploration and identification of patterns in complex data collections. In this work a data visualization system was developed, called AirFareVis for the pur- pose of exploring airfares data. This system allows the interactive exploration of hundreds of thousands of trips. To bridge the inherent complexity of the data, AirFareVis employs a vari- ety of data visualization techniques, such as multiple coordinate views, scented widgets, Gantt Chart, and so on. The system was developed using web technologies, in order to allow mobility and ease of application sharing. To validate the effectiveness of the system use cases are presented using airline ticket deals data mined from the Melhores Destinos website. These use cases show the power of interactive data visualization in identifying airlines’ market behavior patterns with regard to ticket prices. In this way, it was verified that the tool fulfilled its purpose, since it was possible to analyze cases with different parameters, as well as punctuate some behaviors, such as the periodicity of posting promotions and competition between companies.",UFPE,AIRFAREVIS: A VISUALIZATION TOOL FOR INTERACTIVE AIR RATE DATA ANALYSIS
2016,Computer Science,"The World Wide Web contains a vast amount of data from a diverse set of domains, e.g., real estate, cars and products. A significant amount of this data exhibits a structure representing entities and its attributes and respective values. Data of structured entities can be used, for instance, to improve search engine results, and for data-driven analytics. An important step in acquiring this data is its extraction from HTML pages. Unfortunately, most of this data is not ready for automatic consumption, making its extraction challenging. In this work, we present REX (Real Estate eXtractor), a semi-supervised extractor capable of extracting structured data from entities in the real estate domain. REX first detects nodes that contain important attributes using domain knowledge. Using these nodes, it detects regions that contain relevant informa- tion. After the identification of the attributes that appear in the page, REX segments the text found in relevant regions and extract the attribute-value pairs. Experimental evaluations con- ducted using over 60 sites in the real estate domain show that REX is effective, achieving high values of precision and recall for most of the sites.",UFPE,Extracting Structure of Web Entities with Poor Supervision
2016,Computer Science,"Data and storage processing demand is constantly growing every year. User penetration into Internet at 2015 reached expressive 43%, almost half the world population. Distributed Systems came to supply these needs, many times, created by this growth. The State of Art at distributed systems context is realized so that the programmer does not need to worry about orthogonal tasks in his application, such as network or location issues. The aim of this work is to build a remote procedure call middleware that is intended to facilitate the development of distributed applications. Remote procedure calls extend the well-known procedure call abstraction to distributed systems. They aim at letting a remote procedure invocation behave as if it were a local invocation (VÖLTER; KIRCHER; ZDUN, 2004). The implementation will be done in Erlang because it is a programming language focused on Distributed Systems that has some interesting characteristics, such as fault tolerance and functional paradigm. In addition, a performance analysis will be made on the middleware.",UFPE,Implementation and Analysis of an RPC-based middleware using Erlang
2016,Computer Science,"In recent years, the use of renewable energy sources, especially wind power, has been growing and attracting more and more investment. In order to reach global climate targets for sustainable development, investment in renewable energy is expected to double by 2020 and more than triple by 2030, according to a new report from The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) [1]. The availability of this type of energy depends on the wind speed, which is quite variable. The estimation of this element is a factor of great relevance for wind farm operators. This work proposes a method to estimate the wind speed, in order to use in power curve certification of wind turbines, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in parallel with fluid simulation software based on anemometer towers' data and wind turbines' energy generation.",UFPE,USE OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR WIND SPEED ESTIMATION AND POWER CURVE CERTIFICATION IN WIND TURBINES
2016,Computer Science,"The effort spent by software organizations with maintenance and rework in software development can vary, on average, between 40% and 50% of the total development effort. With the growth of systems and their complexities, human's natural ability to perform maintenance is compromised. To mitigate this, different processes and proposals are applied in maintenance context to try to identify targets of possible code inspections, such as: manual code verification, testing, validation, static analysis, and others. Software visualization, however, is also a field that provides an alternative to mitigate this problem. This field assembles techniques and approaches to construct clear, objective and useful visions in the analysis of software systems, whether in the context of evolution, version control, code inspection, and others. There are several approaches to building system visualizations, and each one has its advantages and disadvantages. Swift is a new language with notorious and growing adoption by the developer community. Despite this fact, few studies and initiatives are focused on Swift code analysis. The purpose of this work, then, is to construct a tool for visualization of systems written in Swift, based on the city metaphor (Wettel, 2007). In addition, this research also aims to collaborate with research on the use of Swift carried out by Professor Fernando Castor. To achieve these objectives, studies were done on the construction and visualization techniques of software to understand the difficulties and needs of a good visualization. And studies were made to relate the mapping of the elements of the Swift language to the development of the city metaphor. In this way, it was possible to offer a platform that is useful, easy to use and allows to explore Swift code systems in search of non-obvious conclusions about it.",UFPE,Swift: Visualizing Software's System in Swift as cities

2016,Computer Science,"The usage of recommendation systems has become important in the business environment. In this way, these systems need to create an user profile and go beyond just a list of purchased products. The additional information needed to build the user profile is usually on social networks. However, some social networks, such as Instagram, has most of their content presented in images, which are not textual information, making it difficult to process by traditional recommendation systems. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to create a solution for image classification of Instagram photos, with the focus of identifying the environments where these photos were taken. The solution was built with the deep learning artificial neural network, which has obtained recent good results in image classification. To exemplify, three environments were chosen: gym, nightclub and beach.",UFPE,Instagram photo recognition with deep learning
2016,Computer Science,"Extracting data to support several types of applications and businesses alongside the mass adoption of smartphones which, being loaded with sensors, provide a rich collection of data about their users, has been a growing trend during the last few years. Among the possible pieces of data to extract, the users’ location stands out. This information is traditionally obtained through GPS, however, the system suffers a great precision loss in indoor environments. In this context, it is common to trust in the smartphone’s inertial sensor readings to infer its user’s position, in an inertial navigation process named dead reckoning. This dissertation intends to perform a systematic study about dead reckoning techniques for indoor localization. The work discusses the localization process in interiors according to a historical perspective of the subject. Subsequently, it explores general concepts about dead reckoning in the aforementioned context, as well as problematics and previously developed techniques. In particular, the dissertation shows how data gathered from the sensors of a smartphone can be transformed into relevant information. Finally, this work presents the implementation of a reliability module for dead reckoning.",UFPE,A Systematic Study on Dead Reckoning Techniques for Indoor Location
